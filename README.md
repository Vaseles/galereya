<h4>A small site with cosplay photos of my favorite comics and novels, in addition to simply zooming in on the photo, you can also change its filters: sepia, grayscale and brightness. The project is active, I plan to import other people's photos with their editing and increase the editing buttons, add: saturate, contrast and other effects, if you have any ideas write or add a commit</h4>
